	<p>Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you<br /> 
In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you<br /> 
The ink flows down into a dark puddle<br /> 
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!<br /> 
But in this world of infinite choices<br /> 
What will it take just to find that special day?<br /> 
What will it take just to find that special day?<br />

<p>Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?<br /> 
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway<br /> 
When I can't even read my own feelings<br /> 
What good are words when a smile says it all?<br /> 
And if this world won't write me an ending<br /> 
What will it take just for me to have it all?<br />
